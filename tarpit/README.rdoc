== Description

TarPit provides the glue for an unholy union of build tools. Namely:

* Rake[http://github.com/jimweirich/rake] with
  Hoe[http://seattlerb.rubyforge.org/hoe/] for gem publishing
* Maven[http://maven.apache.org/] for Java builds with dependencies.

In particular, it runs "mvn package" when needed, links jars to the
gem lib directory, and provides (semi-)automatic Manifest.txt
generation with these jar files without offending Hoe.

* The Maven pom.xml (and assembly.xml if needed) must be managed
  independently.
* A Manifest.static file holds the static elements of the manifest.

== Synopsis

Rakefile example for a gem including a single jar, built from java
source with maven:

  # -*- ruby -*-
  $LOAD_PATH << './lib'
  require 'mygem/version'

  require 'rubygems'
  gem     'rjack-tarpit', '~> 1.2.0'
  require 'rjack-tarpit'

  t = RJack::TarPit.new( 'mygem', MyGem::VERSION, :no_assembly, :java_package )

  t.specify do |h|
    h.developer( "David Kellum", "dek-oss@gravitext.com" )
    h.extra_deps += [ [ 'rjack-slf4j',  '~> 1.5.11' ],
                      [ 'rjack-logback, '~> 0.9.18' ] ]
  end

  file 'Manifest.txt' => [ 'lib/mygem/version.rb' ]

  t.define_tasks

== Dependencies

Besides the explicit gem dependencies, TarPit requires:

* rake 0.8.7+ (currently bundled with JRuby 1.3)
* Apache Maven 2.x ('mvn' command on path)
